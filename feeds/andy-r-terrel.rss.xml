These past two years we have successfully found funding for numerous events, several projects, and continue to grow in membership.  The current board has worked hard to start something from scratch and part of that process is defining how to rotate the board. NumFOCUS will be hosting its first elections this&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="new-offices"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New&amp;nbsp;Offices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The election will open up two board positions and a number of titled positions for running different aspects of the community.  These positions include the following Vice President&amp;nbsp;offices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology&lt;/strong&gt;: Responsible for managing the NumFOCUS web&amp;nbsp;presence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fundraising&lt;/strong&gt;: Responsible for coordinating fundraising events and corresponding with&amp;nbsp;sponsors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communications&lt;/strong&gt;: Responsible for managing web content, blogs, and corresponding with&amp;nbsp;membership.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programs&lt;/strong&gt;: Responsible for coordination of NumFOCUS sponsored programs such as fellowships, conference events, and so&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assistant Treasurer&lt;/strong&gt;: Responsible for managing project funds and correspondence with those&amp;nbsp;projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="nominate"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nominate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this coming months, NumFOCUS would like to give an opportunity to the community nominate new board members.  In the future, NumFOCUS would like to have open general elections, but this year we have opted for the current board to pick the next board. This decision was not reached lightly as we give high value to open source principles of openness and transparency. The mutual feeling though was to continue to grow the community, we need to actively pursue a wide breadth of individuals. The best way to achieve this is for the current board to pick individuals that are able to fill gaps corresponding to the organizations&amp;nbsp;needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="who-to-nominate"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who to&amp;nbsp;nominate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who makes a good NumFOCUS board member? First we are looking for people who are passionate about scientific / technical computing tools. Second, we are looking for leaders in the community who are able to connect NumFOCUS with important projects that are highly used. Finally, we have some specific needs such as web development and accounting skills and members of the R or Julia&amp;nbsp;communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board also tries to maintain a diverse mix of individuals from academia, industry, and research laboratories. While there is no quota to this mix, this consideration will be kept in mind when choosing the next&amp;nbsp;board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="terms"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Terms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current board was elected without terms kept in mind. While we love all our board members, we realize that a rotating board has many advantages. Going forward we would like to have yearly elections with each board member elected to a two year term. By alternating between half the board being elected each year, we will have a fair amount of overlap to keep the day to day affairs in order.  Board members will not be limited to a specific number of&amp;nbsp;terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="schedule"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Schedule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to have the newly elected board installed by the annual SciPy conference in Austin, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TX&lt;/span&gt; July 6-12, 2014.  We will be accepting nominations until May 28, 2014.  At that point the board will contact the nominated people and update the board membership upon&amp;nbsp;acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-to-nominate"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to&amp;nbsp;nominate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To nominate an individual, or nominate yourself, please send an email to  &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:admin&amp;#64;numfocus.org"&gt;admin&amp;#64;numfocus.org&lt;/a&gt; with details about the individual and why you think they would be a good&amp;nbsp;fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
